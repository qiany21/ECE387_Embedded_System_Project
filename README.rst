This library provides a set of functions for interfacing the I2C LCD with ATmega 328P and a sample program for guiding you to start using it. Note the original authors of this library is Davide Gironi(Enable I2C on LCD) and Peter Fleury(LCD Driver). The library has almost all the functions that we normally use except for clear a specific line and print integer on the LCD. I have added those two functions into the library so that we can use it like we did in our LCD lab.
